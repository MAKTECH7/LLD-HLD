LLD focuses on scalability, maintainability(Easily Debuggale) , Re-usability (Plug & play model)

HLD :
  Architecture -> Internal design details for building the applications

Monolithic architecture -> if all the components and functionalities of a project are entangled and combined in a single codebase, then that is a monolithic application.

Monolithic architecture has less complexity -> Easier to understand -> Higher productivity 

(Means written and deployed together)

Monolithic system is also known as centralized system.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
advantages :

When it is good,

When we are just starting

In monolithic architecture, all the modules are present in the single system, so they require fewer network calls as compared to other architectures.

It is comparatively easier to secure monolithic system

Integration testing is easier

Less confusion
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Disadvantages of Monolithic Architecture

In monolithic architecture, every module is combined in a single system, so if there is an error or bug in a single module, it can destroy the complete system.

In monolithic architecture, whenever a single module is updated, the whole system needs to be updated to reflect the changes to the users. All modules are present in a single system and are connected to one another, so the whole system needs to be updated.

In monolithic architecture, if there is any change in a single module’s programming language or framework, it will affect the entire system. The entire system needs to be changed because every module is interlinked and tightly coupled.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Very Easy Language (Best for Understanding)

In monolithic architecture, all modules are part of one system. If one module fails, the entire system can stop working.

When any single module is updated, the whole application must be updated because all modules are connected.

If we change the programming language or framework of one module, it affects the entire system because everything is tightly connected.
